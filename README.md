# Neuropixel Ephys Spike Sorting Pipeline on Kempner AI Cluster

This document outlines the workflow for performing spike sorting on electrophysiological recorded data using Kilosort4.0, Kilosort2.5, or spykingcircus2  method on Kempner AI cluster. Please refer [HMS Cluster](HMS-cluster/README.md) if you plan to use Harvard Medical School's O2 Cluster.  This pipeline is a derivative of the one available at [Allen Neural Dynamics GitHub](https://github.com/AllenNeuralDynamics/aind-ephys-pipeline).

To run the analysis on FASRC, please refer to [Kempner AI Cluster README](pipeline/kempner_cluster/README.md). 

To run the analysis on HMS IT RC, please refer to [HMS O2 Cluster README](pipeline/hms_cluster/README.md).
